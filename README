h1. Welcome to Stwiky

Stwiky is a simple site where you may keep all the small things you need to remember in your everyday life. The focus is on speed, there is no overhead in clicking and configuring.

h2. Adding and editing notes
 
* To add a note, double click anywhere on your board.
* To edit a note, double click it.
* Drag and resize your notes as you like.

h2. Formatting 

Stwiky uses "Textile":http://redcloth.org/textile formatting for the notes. This markup language let's you easily format texts:

* ==*asterisks*== to say something *strongly*
* ==_underscore_== for _emphasis_
* =="Links":http://codez.ch== to your "webpage":http://codez.ch
* "and" @much@ __more__ ...

That's it, and now get sticky with it!
